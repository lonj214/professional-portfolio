## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
- Create a GitHub repository. I gave it a unique name, made it public, added a MIT liscense, and a README file.
- I opened my GitHub professional-portfolio repository in VS code.
- In the terminal command line I used git commands to create a directory. Then opened the file in VS code by entering "code ." into the command line.
- In VS code built my HTML file, while working on a feature branch. To do this enter on the command line "git checkout -b feature/add-html".
- I added my correct HTML tags, a navbar(with working links), images, a screenshot of my "Horieseon" webpage that works as a link to the actual webpage. I also  included information about myself, a profile photo, and how to get into contact with me. 
- After completeing work in HTML enter in command line "git add -A", followed by "git commit -m 'add html'", then "git pull origin main", and finally "git push origin feature/add-html".
- I opened my GitHub repository and completed the merge the pull request.
- In command line enter "git checkout" to return to main branch, followed by "git pull origin main".
- Before starting on my CSS file created a new feature branch called "feature/add-css". 
- In VS code I created an "Assets" folder, then created a styles.css file under it. I made sure to link the styles.css to my HTML file.
- I also added all of my images into my "Assets" folder.
- In my styles.css I used my HTML classes to build my CSS. I added background photos, flex boxes, variables, and media queries. I established my font sizes and colors. I also added pseudo element "hover" to my navbar and "contact" information. 
- When I finished with the CSS I pushed it to my GitHub repository and merged the pull request.
- I added comments to my styles.css and my index.html.
- I added to my README file.
- I deployed my repository.
